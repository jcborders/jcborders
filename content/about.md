Hi! My name is James Borders. I'm a speech pathologist specializing in dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) in the acute and outpatient settings. I'm interested in using research to improve patient outcomes, with an emphasis on open science and reproducibility.

You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JamesCBorders), assess ongoing research at [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/n84bd/), or examine code repositories at [GitHub](https://github.com/jcborders).
